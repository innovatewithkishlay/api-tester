# API Tester

[![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/open--source-brightgreen)](https://github.com/innovatewithkishlay/api-tester)  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/innovatewithkishlay/api-tester)](https://github.com/innovatewithkishlay/api-tester/blob/main/LICENSE)

A delightfully open-source API testing tool built with React and TypeScript.  
Quickly build, send, and view API requests with support for all the HTTP verbs you love (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), customizable headers, JSON request bodies, syntax-highlighted responses, request history, and environment variable substitution â€” all in a UI that wonâ€™t make your eyes bleed.

Environment variables make creating reusable API requests a breeze. Itâ€™s like Postman, but lighter, faster, and with fewer corporate popups.

Open source and community contributions are always welcome (and encouraged)!

## Usage

### 1. Manage Environments

- Use the Environments panel at the top to create named environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
- Add key-value pairs for variables like `baseUrl`, `token`, etc.
- Environments are saved locally (in your browserâ€™s localStorage, not in the cloud â€” your secrets are safe).

### 2. Select Active Environment

- Pick your active environment from the dropdown.
- Variables from this environment will be substituted in your requests (magic!).

### 3. Build and Send Requests

- Select HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- Enter the request URL. Use variables like `{{baseUrl}}/api/users`.
- Add or edit request headers (with variable substitution, e.g., `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}`).
- For methods with bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH), enter valid JSON and use variables.
- Click **Send Request** and watch the magic happen.

### 4. View Responses and History

- See status code, time taken, headers, and JSON data (with syntax highlighting, because you deserve it).
- Request history panel lists previous requests â€” click to reload and relive your finest moments.
